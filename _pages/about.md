At present, I am fortunate to be a visiting student at **California Institute of Technology (Caltech)**, working under the guidance of **Dr. [Shengchao Liu](https://chao1224.github.io/)** and **Prof. [Anima Anandkumar](http://tensorlab.cms.caltech.edu/users/anima/index.html)**. Iâ€™m currently a Year 4 Undergrad pursuing a dual degree in **Chemistry** and **Computer Science** at **Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST)**.

My research interests focus on AI for Science, particularly **AI for Chemistry**. My current work revolves around Multi-modal Foundation Models for Molecules, 3D Graph Generative Models, GNNs, and Molecular Representation Learning.
