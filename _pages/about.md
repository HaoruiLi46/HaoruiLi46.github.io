I am currently a first-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science and Engineering at The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), advised by Prof. Shengchao Liu.

Previously, I was an undergraduate researcher at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), where I worked under the supervision of Prof. Anima Anandkumar. I obtained my B.Eng. in Computer Science and B.S. Chemistry from Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST).

My research interests lie in Generative Models, with a focus on AI for Science. My current work centers on 3D geometry-aware generative models for molecules, Transformer-based 3D representation learning, and multimodal foundation models that integrate molecular structures with textual information.
